This RAG chatbpt retrieves information from the markdown file 'FAQ', which is FAQ for non-existing company 'NovaCore' that was generated by ChatGPT.

## Install dependencies

1. First, do the following steps (because of possible challenges installing `onnxruntime` through `pip install onnxruntime`)

    - For MacOS users, first install `onnxruntime` dependency for `chromadb` using:

    ```python
     conda install onnxruntime -c conda-forge
    ```

     - For Windows users, follow the guide [here](https://github.com/bycloudai/InstallVSBuildToolsWindows?tab=readme-ov-file) to install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools. 


2. Install dependenies in the `requirements.txt` file. 

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install markdown depenendies with: 

```python
pip install "unstructured[md]"
```

## Create database

Create the Chroma DB.

```python
python create_database.py
```

## Query the database

Query the Chroma DB.

```python
python query_data.py "What is NovaCore?"
```

> You'll also need to set up an OpenAI account (and set the OpenAI key in your environment variable) for this to work.
